    <p>French fries</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound russet potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices, then slice
        sections into 3/8-inch-wide sticks. Place potatoes in a bowl of cold
        water. Let soak to release excess starches, about 5 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour boiling water over the potatoes until they're covered by a few
        inches. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer onto some
        paper towels. Blot off excess water and let cool completely, at least 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cooled potatoes in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and season with
        cayenne; toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket.</li>
      <li>
        Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries. Continue frying
        until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Toss fries with salt in a
        mixing bowl. Serve immediately.
      </li>
